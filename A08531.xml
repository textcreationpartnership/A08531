            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Nowe marke I pray you, howe ridiculous this illation of Romiſh doctours is: I haue prayed that though thou doe thriſe denie mee, and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forſweare mee; yet neuertheleſſe thy faith ſhall not quite faile: therefore neither Peter nor the Pope canne erre in anye point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuppoſe that CHRIST had prayed that PETER ſhould neither erre in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor faile in the temptation now at hand; what doth this aduantage your holie father the Pope? for if this be to be vnderſtood of the Pope, then muſt hee alſo firſt bee ſifted by Sathan as Peter was, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

denie Chriſt as Peter did: for if the one part muſt be vnderſtood of the Pope, then of neceſſitie muſt the other be alſo: and ſo conſequently muſt you needes confeſſe (as well you may) that the Pope is a denier of Chriſt, and a ſhamefull forſwearer of him</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this text doth indeede quite ouerthrowe your Romiſh Religion: for your doctours ioyntly, teach that Chriſts prayer is availeable for the Pope, to keepe him from errour, not in the Temple, or Pulpit or cloſet or any other common or priuate place; but onely in his chayre, conſiſtorie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in debating doubtfull cauſes of Religion: as if Chriſt had prayed not for the men, but for the walls, which is directly againſt the words of our Sauior: for he ſaith not, I haue prayed for thy chaire, tribunals, Courts, conſiſtories, and Councels, that they ſhall not erre; but hee ſaith, I haue prayed for thee, noting his perſon, that thy faith, that is the perſwaſion of thine heart beleeuing in mee, ſhall not vtterly faile. Loe here, Chriſt prayed for Peters perſon, and not for Peters chaire.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, although Peter had great confidence in him ſelfe, ſaying: <note n="x" place="margin">Luke. 22. 33</note> I am readie to goe with thee into priſon and to death. <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn, 13 37</note> I will lay downe my life for thy ſake: and <note n="z" place="margin">Math. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33.</note> though that all men ſhould bee offended by thee, yet would I neuer bee offended. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (I ſay) all this Peter demed him thriſe, and ſware that he knew not the man.</p>
                  <p>Now as Peter truſting two much in himſelfe, and eſteeming more of himſelfe then his fellow diſciples did, chanced to fall more ſhamefully then all they: ſo your holy father the Pope, truſting to much in his owne ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eſteeming more of himſelfe, then all other Biſhoppes doe, happeneth to oppoſe himſelfe againſt Chriſt, and to doe farre worſe then all others.</p>

                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:13802:48"/>As Peter therefore, finding his faith to haue quai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, acknowledged his fault, &amp; went out at the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cocke, and wept bitterly: ſo your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſucceſſour of Peter, finding himſelfe to haue fallen away from the true God into idolatrie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie, ſhould with Peter acknowledge his fault, and goe out of BABYLON, and weepe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,</p>

                     </note> prelate, in the yeare 607. beganne to diſpute, that Rome was alwaies the Ladie of the whole World: and therefore that it was meete that the Biſhoppe of that Citie ſhould goe before other Biſhoppes in degree and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                  <p>Now to attaine this, was a thing moſt difficult: for albeit that the Emperour did let it ſlippe; yet did the Biſhoppes of other nations confidently gainſay him alleadging lawfull cauſes why they withſtood him: vnwilling to acknowledge the Biſhop of Rome, otherwiſe then for a brother, companion and in power equall with them. Notwithſtanding all this, the ſaid Maleface of Rome deſiſted not but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vrged to attaine vnto his purpoſe, vntill hee had by manie requeſtes and gifts obtained of wicked Phocas the Emperour (who murthered his Maiſter the Emperour Mauritius and his children, to come to the Empire, and was after ſlaine himſelfe by Heraclius that ſucceeded him) that hee might

be called the head of the Catholicke and vniuerſall Church, or the oecumenicall and vniuerſall Biſhop. which title of blaſphemie, when as Iohn the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke of Conſtantinople hadde chalenged not long beefore, viz. about the yeare 602.

Nowe the Pope is your Prince of Prieſtes, (for ſo Cardinall <note n="h" place="margin">Bellarm. de Pontif.

ſo that hee chance to die thereof (for more gently then ſo they meane not to deale with them) let him blame no man but himſelfe: for they thinke that after they haue giuen him this faire warning, they are now diſcharged in conſcience both before God &amp; man, &amp; therefore are guiltleſſe, what harme ſoeuer come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by meanes of the Racke, yea though hee die thereon as innocent as the childe newelie borne.</p>

                  <p>Sir; it would haue beene a wonder to all the world, if that they had pardoned ſuch a viperous inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parricide.

Thirdly, they were no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner turned off the Ladder, but the Rope was cut, and they let fall downe, to ſhew the ſequele and effect of treaſon, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how that they digge a pit for others, &amp; fall into it themſelues. Fourthly, they were noe ſooner fallen downe, but the executioner ſnatched them vp, laid them on a blocke, cut of their ſecrets, and caſt them into the fire, to ſhew that traytors are vnworthie to be begotten, or to beget others. Fifty, their bellies were ripped vp, and there hearts torne out, &amp; throwne into the ſame fire, becauſe they were the fountaine of ſuch an vnnaturall and vnhearde of treacherie. Sixtly, as they though to haue cut off the head from the members in the ciuill bodie; ſo were their heads cut off from the members of their bodies. and their wickedneſſe turned on their owne heades, Seuently, their heads being cut off, their bodies were diuided into quarters, as they were diuided from the found members in the ciuill bodie. Laſtly, their quarters were ſet vpp vppon the gates of the Citie; that as their graceleſſe attempts were an ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to others: ſo their quarters there expoſed to the eyes of all men, might be a good caueat to others.</p>

But Chriſt met Peter at Rome: therfore Peter was at Rome. By this I prooued two thinges and ſingular myſteries of our fayth. First, that Petr was at Rome, againſt them that chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Peter was neuer there. Secondly that if Peter mette chriſt bodily (as Abdiasreporteth, and which I am ſure is true or elſe ſuch an Auncient and holy father would neuer haue written it) then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe quently he may aſwel be bodily in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſacrament, as he was met bodily.

Then ſaid I, cur non reſpondes haereticoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haeriticiſſime?
